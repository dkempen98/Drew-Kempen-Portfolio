# Drew-Kempen-Portfolio

## Description

This is my portfolio. It will need some brushing up as I continue to develop as a programmer but this is a 
good starting point. The applications listed are not actually things I have made and will be replaced when
I am able to. This is more of a proof of concept than an actual portfolio in its current state.
